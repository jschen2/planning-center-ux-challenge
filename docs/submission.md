## Design Challenge Rationale
For each task, please give a brief description of your process, your reasoning used to make the changes and how you feel the change benefits the overall app. We work collaboratively at Planning Center, so being able to communicate the intent, purpose or motivation of your change is often just as important as the code itself!

### Task 1: Update form accessibility

The card type buttons were changed to become two radio inputs to allow for default accessibility and for full usage
as a form due to all being form elements (e.g. using the form action instead of a fetch call). This could also allow
for refactoring the form use a React server function.

The card list was also made navigable and labels added for the card type and card number.
